Journal#2 (08-17-11)

I'm glad this day because my professor in history is absent and we shall have our recitation today and I did not review
for it. Only when I'm in class that I review. It was a tiring day again for me though we have half day only but we still need to do our project in history and other
subjects. I think this week is a stressful week because it is the week that we need to do our projects and some other 
professors ask us to do assignments. I'm not culture shocked with this kind of school works. When I was in Highschool
it is the same as every end of our grading. We need to pass our projects.
