It is a good thing that our professor in History didn't watch the video project that we made in our class. I had some 
some errors in our movie project because our bloopers is too long that it took almost a half of the movie. I forgot to 
cut some bloopers. That should only be in 4 minutes but the one that I burned it took 8 minutes. Our professor told us
that we will try to watch our projects this comming wednesday (I'm hoping that she would change her mind). Thus, I think
that I will be changing that disc that I have given to my professor this comming wednesday. I will proofread it again
so that it will have less errors. In our compfun, we had our last discussion because our next meeting would be the checking
of our project. My professor told his final message to us, a message of gratitude. In our Algeb class, we had our quiz
and after we finished our quiz we may go. I did finish it early because I'm hungry but I'm pretty sure that my answers in
the quiz was right. I don't know its just my prediction.  well, if it fail I will make sure that I will get high grade
in our final exam. I will do my very best to pass the exam because my professor was telling us lately that the finals
was hard to pass. I will make sure that I will pass her final examination.This day is unusual because I'm not used to go 
home early.
