It is just a normal day for me. We have our activity in bibstud wherein we need to discuss the somewhat advertisement/
mini billboard that we have made. I don't know what to call it or maybe I just forget. It was funny because two of our
blockmates were asked by our professor "How many pairs of animal did moses rode in his ship?" then they were thinking
to such extent that they almost had 5-8 minutes of thinking and making their wild guess in their minds. They were afraid 
because our professor was making a joke that he would fail them if they don't answer the question. After several minutes 
of thinking they realized that Moses didn't had a boat. I thought they wouldn't realize that.
