Journal #1 (08 - 16 - 11)

This day was a tiring and stressful day for me cause' I always remember the things I should do / finish when I got home and
it gives me a headache. Even I'm too much busy for school works such as projects atleast I know I'm doing something
productive. I don't get bored in our house cause' I'm doing something worth to do. Some of our projects are to be pass next
week and I'm doing it as early as now so that I don't cram this comming weekend. Tomorrow we will have our recitation in
history and sad to say that I get lazy to read the topic that we will discuss tomorrow it is because I'm suffering now
from headache due to lots of works. Maybe tomorrow morning I will read it because I always go to school early.
