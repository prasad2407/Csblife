This day I need to go to church alone because I failed to go with my family yesterday. At morning, I was somewhat irritated
with my laptop because it was so slow when I was rendering our video. Thus, my software had a problem last night because
the movie that I'm rendering didn't buff. So, I don't know how to solve that problem and it was my first time that I 
encountered that problem. I don't know what to do and I just continue that process that I have been doing in the past
video editing that I did. When it was noon, I was rendering our video again crossing my fingers that the video would be 
fine. I'm going to chuch to celebrate mass at 3 pm in greenbelt. I left my laptop open because it was rendering our video
when I went to the church. When I got home from the church it was a mircle that the one I rendered was fine and it was
buffering like a normal video. Then I thank god for it. Thus when I was to burn our project into a cd. I insert a 700mb
disc knowing that our video wouldn't have much bytes then when I saw it in nero burning rom. It was over to the size of 
the disc. Then I was cramming that time because it was 7 in the evening and I was planning to go to SM to buy a DVD disc.
Because we don't have DVD disc. Then suddenly I saw one DvD disc and there was a note "Damage Disc" even though I still
tried to burn and it was fine. I thought I would had a hard time burning our project.
