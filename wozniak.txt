How can I apply Wozniak's system for myself and for this course?

   First, it was a good thing to know that there's a guy who have a great mind and invented such thing that can help lots
of people suffering in forgetting things easily worldwide. Curiousity to something make sense because you can create
create something useful for every one else. 
   Wozniak's System is an important thing for me because it will help me improve my knowledge, my thinking capacity and my
skills in remembering things. As time passby  I know I will need wozniak's system in my daily life. It will help me to
remember things I could not easily remember. Thus, I will also improve my skills in time management and note taking because
it helps me a lot to remember things. Time management in a way that I have my list of things to do for a certain day and
I must finish it all before I go to sleep. Written reminders or note taking also help me because sometimes I'm so busy with
something that I forgot other things. Wozniak's system is very helpful in my course because I need to be a fast learner
and I should remember all the things that the professor had taught me. It will help me in my future projects, assignments,
quizzes, midterms, finals, etc. Thus, remembering things help me improve my works in schools and outside school. Maybe,
I should start practicing it by now and see if there's something improved in my remembering skills.
