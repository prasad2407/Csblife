Journal#5 (08-20-11)

It is weekend already but it isn't the time for me to rest because I need to finish our history project and some other
projects. I woke up as early as 6 am to fix my things and get ready to go to patch house. I will be there because their 
group asked me if they can borrow my camera. My camera is expensive so I need to take care of it or else my parents would
be mad at me if suddenly I lost it and I don't want it to happen. So, our departure time from our meeting place was 8 am
sharp but suddenly some of their groupmates were late. We move to their house at 8:30 am. Then, when we were there they
were shooting for their project in history then I was fixing our movie in patch's house. Then, when we were all done with
our projects, we decided to go to swimming near their house. It was fun because we had a bonding moment with each other
even though we were 5 only but that's okay. I failed to go to celebrate mass with my family in glorietta because of our
projects. It was Fr. Suarez whose the mass celebrant at that time.
