This day is our presentation of different kinds of exercises in Physical Education. It is half of our final grade so we
need to perform it well. Thus, I don't know what happen because we don't get perfect grade in one of the exercises we
performed. Well, that's okay for me because we got a grade of 95 and above. I had fun dancing our aerobic dance, I don't
know what happen to me because when we did that dance last time in our practical, I easily get tired but when I did it
in our finals. I have high energy and I felt like it was too short for that exercise. Well, that's okay because it was
performed by group. In our estheta class, as usual we watched a movie again and after our professor discuss our final
project which he diveded us into several groups. I thought he will ask us to paint or something but I was wrong. He asked
us to make a research about what is aesthetically pleasing in our jeepneys now a days because as we can see it in our 
roads most of our jeepneys have lots of designs and some of them put the names of their relatives, children, etc.
